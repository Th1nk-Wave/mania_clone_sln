# THIS IS DREADFULLY INCOMPLETE

# this code is very messy and half baked
so dont copy anything yet

# how to run it:
- run the python script at assets/converter_compress.py, this will take around half an hour (its python what did you expect)
- if you want to change the resolution of the video so it takes less time to convert then change the "res" value in BOTH the converter_compress.py AND program.cs (the highest it can go is 64)
- inside program.cs change the filepath to the file path of the outputted fileDataCompressed.txt file in assest/
- run the project

# TODO:
- [ ] rename project to a suitible text rpg name
- [ ] some other stuff i guess
- [ ] figure out markdown language
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] add comments to explain stuff
